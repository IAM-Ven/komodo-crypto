## Deployment

### API Keys
In order to run Komodo Crypto, you will need verified accounts and API keys for 
each of our integrated exchanges. You can enter your specific credentials into the 
`application.properties` file in the `resources` directory. Please note, it can 
sometimes take some time to verify your account, and if you have an account with 
coins in it be careful before running any methods that will make actual changes 
to your account.
